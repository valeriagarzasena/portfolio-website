Full-Stack Personal Portfolio Website

A comprehensive web development project focused on creating a responsive, secure, and professionally hosted personal brand platform. This project demonstrates a complete development lifecycle, from raw HTML/CSS to a PHP-powered backend deployed on a cloud-based Linux environment.

>> Technical Stack

    Frontend: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, and Bootstrap (for responsive UI/UX).

    Backend: PHP (Server-side logic, contact form processing, and input validation).

    Infrastructure: AWS (Ubuntu VPS), managed via SSH.

    Web Server: Nginx (Configuration and deployment).

>> Key Features

    Responsive Design: Fully optimized for mobile, tablet, and desktop views using the Bootstrap grid system.

    Secure Contact System: Implemented a functional contact form utilizing PHP for server-side validation and data sanitization to prevent common web vulnerabilities.

    Cloud Deployment: Configured a Linux environment on an AWS EC2 instance to host the live application.

    Asset Management: Organized project structure including custom CSS, JavaScript event handlers, and optimized image assets.

>> Project Evolution

This project was developed incrementally over a 16-week semester, starting with core web fundamentals and evolving into a full-stack application.

    Phase 1: UI/UX Design and HTML/CSS Layout.

    Phase 2: Interactivity via JavaScript and Bootstrap integration.

    Phase 3: Backend integration with PHP for dynamic content and form handling.

    Phase 4: Cloud deployment using Nginx on a Linux-based AWS VPS.

Note on Deployment: This application was successfully hosted and live on an AWS VPS for the duration of its development. The server has since been decommissioned to manage cloud resources, but the full source code and architectural logic are preserved here for review.
